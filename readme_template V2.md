# Project Title

"The objective of this project is to investigate correlation between gni and population over the years."

Correlation:

Investigate if there's a correlation between GNI per capita and population growth for countries.
Determine if countries with higher GNI per capita witness different population growth rates than those with lower GNI per capita.


A great problem statement should be SMART:
   - **S**pecific - The problem statement should clearly define the problem or challenge being addressed, including any relevant context or background information.
   - **M**easurable - The problem statement should identify measurable indicators or criteria that can be used to determine whether the problem has been solved or addressed.
   - **A**chievable - The problem statement should identify goals or objectives that are realistic and attainable given the resources and constraints of the project.
   - **R**elevant - The problem statement should be relevant to the broader context or field of study, and should address a problem or challenge that is important and 
meaningful.
   - **T**ime-bound - The problem statement should identify a clear timeframe or deadline for when the problem needs to be addressed or solved.

By using the SMART framework, you can help ensure that your problem statement is well-defined and focused, and that the goals of the project are clear and achievable.


# Data Dictionary

A data dictionary provides a quick overview of features/variables/columns, alongside data types and descriptions. The more descriptive you can be, the more useful this 
document is. This can also be where you describe additional data sources that have been used.

Example:

|Feature|Type|Dataset|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|**county_pop**|*integer*| .. census|The population of the county (units in thousands, where 2.5 represents 2500 people).|
|**GNI**       |*float*  | .. census|The Gross National income; means .... )|


# Executive Summary

An executive summary is a brief summary of the key points and objectives of a project. The purpose of an executive summary is to provide a high-level overview of the project 
and to give readers a clear understanding of what the project is about and what it aims to achieve.

An effective executive summary should provide a clear and concise summary of the project, including its goals, methodology, key findings, and conclusions. It should be 
written in a way that is easy to understand for a broad audience, including those who may not have technical expertise in the project's subject matter.

Some key elements that may be included in an executive summary are:

* A summary of the problem or challenge the project is addressing
* An explanation of the project's goals and objectives
* A summary of the project methodology, including any data sources, data cleaning, EDA & analysis techniques, or models used
* A summary of the key findings or insights generated by the project. Feel free to include images of your visualizations here!
* A conclusion that summarizes the main results and their implications. You may want to consider the following question as you craft your conclusion: "How can the audience 
use the insights generated by this project to inform their decisions or actions?"
* Next steps - This can include recommendations for future research or analysis, ideas for how to improve upon the project's methodology or data sources, and/or suggestions 
for how to extend or expand the project in new directions.

By including an executive summary in your project's readme file, you can help ensure that readers have a clear understanding of the project's purpose, methodology, and 
findings, even if they don't have time to read the entire document.

**Important note: In order for your readme to display as the default readme file in github, it will need to be named `README.md`. This means that before submitting your 
project, you should either delete or replace the original `README.md` with your own version!**
